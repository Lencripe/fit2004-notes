# Algorithms and Data Structures

#### Summary Notes by [Carlos Melegrito](http://mlgrto.com)

In this repo is everything I've learned while studying the FIT2004 unit at Monash University. It's a collection of summary notes, algorithms and their explanations useful in many areas of computer science. To use these notes, follow along the links in the contents below like a guidebook.
