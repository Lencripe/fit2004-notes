# Strategies and Writing Algorithms

1. Look for good invariants to exploit
2. Attempt to balance your work as much as possible
3. Do not repeat work (store, and re-use!)
4. Use appropriate data representations
5. Try well-known problem solving strategies
6. _Sometimes_ greed is good

### Invariants to Exploit

- Binary Search
- Sorting
- Shortest Paths and Connectivity
- Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms

### Balance Your Work

- Divide and Conquer strategy
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Hirschberg's Algorithm

### Choose Data Structures with Care

- Certain data representations can be more efficient for certain problems
- Priority Queue in Dijkstra's algorithm
- Union-Find data structure in Kruskal's algorithm
- Efficient Search and Data Retrieval

### Don't Repeat Work

- Do not compute anything more than once
- Use Dynamic Programming
	- Edit Distance
	- Largest Common Subsequence Problem
	- Dijkstra's Algorithm

### Sometimes greed is good

- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Prim's Algorithm
- Kruskal's Algorithm
- Green can give a good solution, even if not guaranteed optimal
