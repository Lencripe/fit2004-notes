# Abstract Data Types

An **Abstract Data Type** (ADT) is a mathematical model for a structure of information.

They are composed of:

- a **Definition**
- **Operations**
- **Rules**
- and **Functions**

Some examples of ADTs are:

- Lists
- Trees
- Stacks
- Queues
- Dictionaries

ADTs are used because:

- They make it **easier to reason with complex data structures**, especially when writing complicated algorithms 
	- (e.g. it's easier to say you're working with a 'list' rather than constantly defining a series of variables)
- ADTs have **expected properties and behaviours** by convention, which means they are independent of its implementation 
	- (e.g. a list works like a list, no matter which programming language)
